Change RMI
UDP/TCP connection between Peer and Monitor, Monitor and Tracker
Peer ask Tracker for Peers who are alive 

Create message WakeUp & the protocol| and messages to be sent between Monitor and Tracker

What should the tracker keep in store a list of monitors and peerData?
should the monitorList just be a "copy" of said monitor

The tracker receives messages from the monitors (status updates) if a monitor does not answer after X time -> monitor goes on "probation"
 If monitor answers Peer is dead Tracker gives command to restartPeer, need to check if PeerData Received (after restart) Matches PeerData Stored by Tracker
 If it does no more is done, if it does not,which one is given priority  ?
