Change RMI
UDP/TCP connection between Peer and Monitor, Monitor and Tracker
Peer ask Tracker for Peers who are alive 

Create message WakeUp & the protocol| and messages to be sent between Monitor and Tracker

What should the tracker keep in store a list of monitors and peerData?
should the monitorList just be a "copy" of said monitor

The tracker receives messages from the monitors (status updates) if a monitor does not answer after X time -> monitor goes on "probation"
 If monitor answers Peer is dead Tracker gives command to restartPeer, need to check if PeerData Received (after restart) Matches PeerData Stored by Tracker
 If it does no more is done, if it does not,which one is given priority  ? 
 
 // WAKEUP <Version> <SenderId> <FileId> <ChunkNo> <CRLF><CRLF>
			// this is sent when the SenderID has a chunk and wants to know if
			// the chunk is still in the network, we just need to check
			// Does delete remove from the sent list?
			
			
			// what should we do let him not delete the message? also how
				// should we let him delete the chunk? have a list of deleted
				// files?? Seems like a good way to do things a list of all
				// deleted files, and if FileID in there we send delete if not
				// we send what? nothing a new msg? keepIt, putchunk?
				
				
				// should I go through each file
		// need to know who has each chunk of Files it sent
		// need to let ppl know which chunks it has
		// what do I need for a wakeup msg
		// version 1.0? or higher
		// need senderID
		// need chunkID
		// need chunkNo
		// need fileID
		// No bodies
		// what happens when he send a I have Chunk X of File Y but Chunk
		// X/FileY should not be in the system??
